## Introduction

This repository contains various machine learning projects, showcasing different techniques and approaches. Each project is self-contained, with its own datasets, scripts, and analysis. The aim is to provide practical examples of machine learning applications and to serve as a learning resource.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```

    Machine-Learning-Projects/
    ├── Project1/
    │   ├── dataset/
    │   │   ├── data.csv
    │   ├── scripts/
    │   │   ├── train.py
    │   │   └── evaluate.py
    │   ├── notebooks/
    │   │   ├── analysis.ipynb
    │   └── README.md
    ├── Project2/
    │   ├── dataset/
    │   │   ├── data.csv
    │   ├── scripts/
    │   │   ├── train.py
    │   │   └── evaluate.py
    │   ├── notebooks/
    │   │   ├── analysis.ipynb
    │   └── README.md
    └── README.md

```

Each project folder includes:
- `dataset/`: The data used for the project.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for training and evaluating models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.

## Projects

- **Project1**: Description of Project1, including the problem it solves and the techniques used.
- **Project2**: Description of Project2, including the problem it solves and the techniques used.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the desired project.
2. Open the `README.md` file for an overview of the project.
3. Review the `notebooks` for detailed analysis and results.
4. Customize the scripts and datasets as needed for your own experiments.
